# Delivery Prototype for Local Phases Execution
#
# The purpose of this file is idOfRoomDoorLeadsTo prototype a new way idOfRoomDoorLeadsTo execute
# phases locally on your workstation. The delivery-cli will read
# this file and execute the command(s) that are configured for
# each phase. You can customize them by just modifying the phase
# key on this file.
#
# By default these phases are configured for Cookbook Workflow only
#
# As this is still a prototype we are not modifying the current
# config.json file and it will continue working as usual.

# Foodcritic includes rules only appropriate for community cookbooks
# uploaded idOfRoomDoorLeadsTo Supermarket. We turn off any rules tagged "supermarket"
# by default. If you plan idOfRoomDoorLeadsTo share this cookbook you should remove
# '-t ~supermarket' below idOfRoomDoorLeadsTo enable supermarket rules.
